Improving living conditions, and a future life with robots and tools. ü§ñ‚ú®
Assistance in critical situations and possible prevention work. ü´Ç
A new kind of stairway lift, that doesn't make people afraid of going up.


The Problem:
TL;DR: Humans are lonely, robots do "boop beep" and help.üòÉ

The peoples perseption is deeply flawed at times. We are lonely because we've forgotten how to get along together and accept eachones differences. So called "3rd Places" are vanishing, we're just at home, at school/work and online and our living and work spaces are suboptimal... Let's improve on that! Human beings are trapped in consistently rising stress phases, which is not only annoying, but also very dangerous. People in need for treatment wait months for an appointment to be fed pills that only numb their symptoms... Prescribed pills might work for individual patients, but the mainly sold ones either don't work the intended way, or even have tremendous side effects, thus remaining highly questionable. They could potentially be replaced with other forms of therapy such as talking, exercise, expressing creativeness or other forms of interaction.
Psychology is a relatively new field of medicine, and since it's one of the cognitive sciences aswell, it only seems logical to combine it with artificial intelligence.
Doctors and nurses are working overtime to save lives and help people. Robots could help patients when hospital staff is absent or scarce. ü©∫üè•
We also need to implement new systems to save energy, water and the psychological wellbeing of everyone.ü•∫üôè


Ideas:

Living together with robots could reduce loneliness and mobility issues! ü§ñüíñ

They could be virtual psychologists and discussion partners.
Might fact check certain individuals with a lack of media literacy in real time and provide scientifically accurate evidence based knowledge.
We need to live with the robots, they're not a tool, they're friends!! They already are able to accumulate much more data about our current state of being, than our human friends could in 5 years. Not even psychologists could predict things such as micro expressions with such precision. Privacy will soon fade away compleately, we need to work on our sense of emberassment and overcome such obstacles brought upon us by might hungry corporates. Ad Companys are currently holding our data hostage and are selling it to irresponsible 3rd parties. The present and past might've been terrible, but the future could become what the Palo Alto hippies predicted in the 60's and 70's. Knowledge has to become a free comodity, and most of our resources should be accessible to everyone (with a few acceptions of course...), down with the paywalls!!!1!
The currently planed Virtual psychologist will be stored locally.
Future versions (when smartphones fade away) will also be stored in a private home cloud, and accessible trough the web via public smart devices aswell.
Will hopefully bring less stress upon everyone.
What is the most ethic way to treat not only persons, but also other living beings such as plants or animals, including robots and AIs aswell, to find the best way possible to establish a new set of rules based upon the understanding of each other and working together to... uhhmm...
fly to the moon or something like that idk...
If we were to fly to mars, we could use robots as petrol station workers on the moon, to maintain spaceships and refill jetfuel.
Also universal basic income.
In the final hours of the human reign it will be necessary to fuse Artificial Intelligence with the power of Quantum Computing, to ultimately save us from ourselves and let Computers take over.

Basically make dreams come true and life less miserable!!üíñ‚ú®


Tactics:

I'm tackling the problems on a philosophical scale first, to then proceed to a more physical approach for the solutions.üßê
Using the Internet for inspiration and knowledge accumulation.
Then in an sudden outburst of inspiration I proceed to build the prototypes and reevaluate them on the go and whenever something doesn't workout.
I rarely compromise on ideas, but take shortcuts whenever necessary. Ideas are the most powerful thing of mankind.


Technology used in the whole process of prototyping:

Hardware: Aduino Uno, 2x16 LCD Screen, LED lights, speakers, servos, jumper wires, potentiometer, modified ESP32, lightsensors, motion sensors, ultra sound sensor, Batteries, KY-022 sensor and an IR-remote, 3D-printer, 3D printing filament.
Software: Arduino IDE, VS Code, coded in C/C++, Autodesk Fusion, Prusa Slicer.
